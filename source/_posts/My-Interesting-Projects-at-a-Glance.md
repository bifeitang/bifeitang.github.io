## Research Project
### BCI-Controlled Exoskeleton 

[University of Houston]{.label .info} [Embedded Software Development]{.label .info} [Sept 2020 - Now]{.label .info}

- I am volunteering at Professor [Jose Luis Contreras-Vidal](https://www.ee.uh.edu/faculty/contreras-vidal)'s lab on [BCI-controlled exoskeleton]{.label .primary} at the `University of Houston` for around a year now.  
  - About the project: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02478-0
  - My Work
    - [Architecture design](https://bifeitang.github.io/2020/10/25/ExoSkeleton/FreeRTOS/) for the main controller
    - Establish reliable CAN bus communication between the controller and joints
    - Currently researching how to synchronize the movement of 6 joints
    - You can find my related notes [here](https://bifeitang.github.io/categories/ExoSkeleton/) 

## Personal Interest 

I am interested in learning theories of intelligence. And thanks to the recommendation from Professor Dejan, I started reading books `On Intelligence` and `A thousand theories of Brain` from Jeff Hawkins and get interested in his theory on [HTM](https://numenta.com/htm-implementations/) and [Grid Cells in Neocortex](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2018.00121/full). 

### Grid Cell for Conceptual Learning

- One research referred by Jeff Hawkins in support of his framework for intelligence and grid cell in the neocortex is a work from [Constantinescu](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaf0941), which finds grid-cell-like firing from prefrontal cortex and entorhinal cortex when the subjects are conducting conceptual learning tasks by looking at their fMRI data. I found this particularly interesting, and thanks to the author, I was able to get partial experiment data and followed the step to verify the grid-cell-like firing myself.
