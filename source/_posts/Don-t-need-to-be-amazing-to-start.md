It's 2 am now, but I am staying up late again. This time, it's about a book I am reading before going bed. 

Quote " Do not be afraid of the edge, or not enough knowledge, to put their own not enough, na√Øve and true to reflect, it will be lovely, do not pretend to be. Application topics are the same, if I can see see that you have genuine feelings about this Tem, I will be more able to understand why you want to do this topic, will have confidence in you, trust you will do it"

I have been long anxious on not preparing well enough for my PhD, even I started the preparation 1 year ago. 

It's never occured to me as strong needed until I start working. My cowrokers are working in different styles, some are passionate and they keep coming up with new methods, following the state of art techonologies by reading a lot of papers and reaching ont to the most knowledgable people in the field to figure it out and coming up with all sort of new ideas and solutions for their daily work and push the management allow them more resources to get it done. Some are more focusing on getting the job done with existing requirements and delivered in the most efficient way and started their chill time in style. Both types are really good at what they do and deliver, and 

However, I am personally more attracted by the first type. It gives more meaning to the work itself. In other word, I hope I love the job itslef more than the meaning of the job. What kinds of job deserve that love? I think it's a hard question for most of people including myself. 

I enjoy coding, but coding is just a tool. It's what I build with this tool really matters. I thought it will be blockchain and even did an intership in that area, but the reality beat me down. I then thought about security which also not worked out. Then operating system, also a miss. The latters are not exciting enough in a sense that they are not opening a new field and confined by their imaginations and possibilities they bring to the human kind. I can be good at them, but I will be the second type, a techinitan who lead a life and earn money with it. Asking myself, a voice deep down tells me I would rather be a dreamer with money merely enough to support my daily life, I want to dream big, which makes me excited. Dreams need to compromise against the realistic need. After all these time, I fully understand life is a a sort of dynamic balance between ideal and reality.

I start thinking about the books, the comics, animations I thrilled upon and watched again and again. Ghost in the shell, definitely on the top of my list. Yes, Neuromancer, the classical one. Psychopass, EVA, and all kinds of other cyberpunk and steampunk animation. But of course, I don't want myself to be such sacarsim against its society. I want myself be more realistic and focusing on the techonologies and possiblities. I was like, why not BCI then. I remember since one talk between two Ma, Jack Ma and Elon Musk, they all start with same pronuonceation in Chinese. Elon Musk was enphasing the urgance of broading the bandwidth of human computer communication, right now we can only do it with two hands, what about the future? Using brain to communicate will be a revolution. Then there's neuralink.

Will it be an interesting things to work on? I started reading overview papers in this area and get myself registered to a BCI class, also asked for a volunteer position to get a flavor. 
Since I am so used to lose interest in some thing after a while, but I can tell this one maybe different. Yes, because our brain is fascinating, the more I read about it, the more I am impressed. I still remember the happiness deep down when I realize our neuron circuit are literatly as its name suggested, they can ensemble a circuit with capacitor. I was like why it's so amazing. 

The research at UH is arount one year now, some part are may not as good as expected. But I still practiced my skill in writing embedded system. I think it will be a must have in my future research. 

Besides, my reading about grid cell is also very enjoyable. 

Yes, after one year's trial, I can tell with more certainty that I love BCI, this work itself. How about the meaning behind the work? To be honest, I am ready to be a poor guy in the rest of my life, since I think there might not be a breakthough in 20 years, mature in 40 years. But that's also the fun part to me, I will be able to work on it for my entire life. I won't be bored since its an interdeciplanry area which requires all new techonologies. I will learn all sorts of exciting things in the rest of my life. On the other hand, I will receive all sort of chanllege and witness or even bring it to the next level. I am still able to earn my living by coding as my side project. The worst case

For the time being, it may help with the aging population and disabilities. Imagin with prothesis, epilepsy can be cured and people can watch again. That's fascination. Also AR is coming to its age, with BCI, a lot of things can happen. I with feel the flying one day and literlly surfing in the virtual reality.

Great, enough imagination, down to the groud. I wasn't so sure, even now also not sure should I go invasive or non-invasive, or even pure neural research? 

Different part of them attact me in different ways. 

Invasive, direct cure for the patients
Non-invasive, apply to the general public
Pure neural research, from Jeff Hawkins, figure out how our brain will eventually work. All of them are attractive. 

There's common ground behind them, which are signal processing and statistics. I should improve on it. 

I have been procrastinating to deliver, now it's time, I don't need to be amazing to start, I need to start to be amazing.  :D

I was always worried about what not being knowledgable and passionate. But I think it's more important to be passionate, curious and stay foolish, hungry. I will put whatever I have online first, than start making them look better and more orgainized. (I should stop sorry about not being an orgaized person which eventually even prevent me to deliver)
