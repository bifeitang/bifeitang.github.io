It's 2 am now, and I am staying up late again. I am trying to finish reading a book (*The self as Method: In Conversation with Biao Xiang*) from [Biao Xiang](https://www.compas.ox.ac.uk/people/biao-xiang/). 

I am urged by his words -- "Don't be afraid to be on the edge or not having enough knowledge. Keep your inadequacies and naivety in plain sight, it will be lovely. Don't pretend. The same applies to your research topic application, which must be peculiar. If I can see that you have genuine feelings about the topic, I more convinced by why you want to do it. It makes me having confidence in you, and trusting you to finish your research no matter what."

These words struck my fears like a sermon. I have been anxious for a long time that I am not good enough to apply for PhD.

I never consider seriously having a Ph.D. until I start working. My colleagues teach me two working styles. One group of my coworkers are passionate about their work and keep coming up with new methods. They follow the state of art technologies by reading many papers and reaching out to the most knowledgeable people in the field. They even actively push the management to allow them more resources for innovation. While the other group focuses on getting the job done elegantly and efficiently with clear-defined requirements and starting their chill time in style.

Top performers in each group shine in their way.  However, I am deeply attracted to the first type, which emphasizes more on the work itself. In other words, I hope I love the job itself more than the meaning of the job because the purpose of the job changes over time, but if the job itself keeps revealing the fancy of the world, it will be a whole different story.

However, which job is the one I love? I think it's a tricky question for most people, including myself. I enjoy coding, but coding is just a tool. It's what I build with this tool that genuinely matters. So I started trial and error to find my preferred domain. I started with blockchain and did an internship building distributed apps. But it didn't take me long to realize that what interested me was the utopian vision that the blockchain was building. I then tried security by having classes and participating in CTF competitions. But the reality tells me that I lack talent. I am confident to be experienced and proficient in this field, but it's hard to be at the top. And I may love hacking merely because it sounds cool. Then I had an opportunity to work with the operating system. But I turned it down since it's something I am good at but not passionate about. The ongoing trial and error can be frustrating and exhausting, but I have also learned the importance of balancing ideals and reality more profoundly.

Hard work pays off for a willing heart. I'm still glad I clicked on Coursera's Computational Neural Science class one boring night. That night I had just been intrigued by Elon Musk's pie-in-the-sky talk on Joe Rogan's podcast about a new "Neuralink" product to announce, which claims to make everyone a superhuman. Being skeptical, I started to search around to understand what on earth Neuralink is doing. But the more I learn, the more I am amazed at the wonders of this field. How is it possible that it took human beings thousands of years to learn electronic circuits, but these principles have surprisingly long been part of our bodies supporting our daily physiological activities? Nature already equates each nerve impulse with resistance, capacitance, and inductance. At that moment, I felt loved since each of us is so exquisitely constructed.

Come to think of it, brain-computer interface, cyborg, cyberpunk has always been my favorite topic (check my list). Is it time for us humans to mirror the imagination of science fiction into reality? I thought it was still far from me in 2019 when I first heard Elon Musk emphasized the urgency of increasing the input/output bandwidth for human-computer communication by using BCI.

To verify if I am genuinely interested in this area and if my skill set could support my interest, I started finding research opportunities and connecting with different people in the field. Luckily, I got a volunteer position at the University of Houston to work on exoskeleton BCI. In the meantime, I started to take online courses, read books, and visit forums. Moreover, I would find related papers for exciting topics, contact the writer, and get my hands dirty to reproduce their results.

Through a whole year of accumulation, I am keen to use this blog to share the fun and excitement that BCI has brought me. Although it may take more than half a century to get sci-fi imaginations into reality, I find the challenges themselves fascinating. Understanding how exactly our brain works, what intelligence is, how we can communicate with the mind. It sounds like something I can work on for the rest of my life.
